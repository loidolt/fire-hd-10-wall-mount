## General Info

We wanted to wall mount a tablet in our family room area to act as a hub for the smart home control using Home Assistant dashboards. This mount was designed to screw directly to a 3 gang wall box so we would have a solid mounting fixture, place to get power, hide a power adapter, and allow routing power to the tablet inside the mount.

## Technologies

- Fusion 360

## Setup

An existing 3 gang wall mount will be needed for this wall mount, or it could be screwed directly to a wall surface in a less ideal configuration.

## Usage

The base and cover for this model are split into two pices to allow printing on a standard size printer. Simply glue the two pieces together where they overlap to combine the parts.

The cover screws onto the base using M3 screws.

## Notes

This has been modeled to specifically accomodate the 2021 version of the Fire HD 10.1" tablet.
